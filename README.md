# Snake
Second project for Object-Oriented Programming classes - Snake.
Here description won't be as attractive as the first project's one,
 yet I'll try to make it the best I can.

This is the one very big snake by a skin of ones teeth from crush.
 (More like by a skin of one's fang, cause it is a snake)
